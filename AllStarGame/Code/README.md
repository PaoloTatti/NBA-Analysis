* **EDA - AllStarGame**: unfortunately I was not able to represent the intercative plot that plotly provides, so you will find a notebook and a **.py** file, which contains the code to run the notebook with the right plots. The notebook can be also found at https://www.kaggle.com/politatti/eda-all-star-game-2000-2016
